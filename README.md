# General Purpose Accounting   System 
## Prerequisites
1 - First, make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website ([https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/)).

## Backend setup

1- Once you have Docker installed, open your command line interface and run the following command:

               docker pull enmareynoso/backend-django

This will download the Backend image from Docker Hub to your computer.
    
2 - Next, run the following command to start a container using the "frame-app" image:

        docker run -dp  8000:8000 enmareynoso/backend-django


 This will start a container and map the container's port 8000 to your host machine's port 8000.


## Client setup

1- Once you have Docker installed, open your command line interface and run the following command:

               docker pull enmareynoso/client-nextjs

This will download the Client image from Docker Hub to your computer.
    
2 - Next, run the following command to start a container using the "frame-app" image:

        docker run -dp  3000:3000 enmareynoso/client-nextjs


**Important Note:** Ensure that the backend image is running correctly for the proper functioning of the application.




And that's it! üéâ You are now running the "GpaSystem" inside Docker containers on your machine.
